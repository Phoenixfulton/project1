<h1>Colorism in the Black Community</h1>
				<p> 	As a community, colorism has become such an incredibly large part of our daily lives without us even realizing it. The black people we see in movies are normally picked strategically and therefore not a true representation of who black people are (they are normally picked because they are lighter, prettier, and a better representation of the European look).  Dark Skinned people all over America--and the world-- are forced to deal with the misrepresentation of their culture and lives. Not to mention, the tension that has ensued because of this colorism (Team Lightskin, Team Darkskin.)
Black people everywhere feel mistreated and misrepresented for so many other reasons, one of which being the misconception that being a lighter shade makes you less black than the people who are darker. Giving privilege to someone because of something they canâ€™t choose or change (or adding privilege at all) is the main cause of all of this tension.
These are the main issues that need to change with colorism.
