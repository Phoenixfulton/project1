<h1>About Our Campaign</h1>
		<p>Our campaign goal is to end colorism and to bring awareness to the issues that it creates. We want to stop the tension it brigs between people of the same race and bring everybody together. We don't want for people to be treated unfairly or reefused jobs because of the not on the color, but the sade of their skin. We don't want people to be looked at as privileged because of the color or shade of their skin. We want for everyone to be equal and happy together. Sign this petition to help out!</p>
